# Portfolio

My personal portfolio, built with SvelteKit and Sass.

It's intentionally simple, doesn't use a CMS for content, and has no dynamic data. You can build it, take the build folder and put it on a CDN. It's currently hosted with Vercel because they're the only ones I managed to get PNPM to work on.
